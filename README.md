# Scripts for reducing LOFAR data on Grid-pp 

The follow depository conatins scripts for the purpose of reducing LOFAR data on Grid-pp

Scripts will be added on ongoing basis.

## downloadlofardata.py

This short script allows the user to download already staged data from the LOFAR long term archive (lta) to the user interface and then move that data to the grid via dirac.

The data will be moved to UKI-NORTHGRID-MAN-HEP-disk storage element. 

The only input that the script needs is the html.txt file containing the addresses of the staged data. This file is sent to the user by the lta once the data has been archived.
